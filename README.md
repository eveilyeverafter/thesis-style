This is a template for building a thesis for the University of Idaho. It is slightly modified from a UBC [template](https://github.com/richfitz/thesis-style) by Rich FitzJohn.

This template can be compiled with `pdflatex` simply by downloading the repository and typing

```
make
```

Designed to work with Minon Pro -- see [here](https://gist.github.com/richfitz/2324707) for installation instructions.  Will fall back on Palatino.
